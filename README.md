# Weather-app
This Weather App provides users with an intuitive and visually appealing interface to check the current weather conditions of any location. Users can search for cities and receive detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. The app features a modern, responsive design that adapts seamlessly across devices. Key highlights include smooth animations for weather transitions, an interactive UI, and a simple layout for easy navigation. While the app fetches real-time weather data via a weather API, it focuses on delivering an excellent user experience with no backend required. This project showcases how to integrate external APIs and build a polished, responsive frontend with effective user interaction.
